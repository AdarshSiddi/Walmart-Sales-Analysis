# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
This readme file explains how to use the Python libraries Pandas, Numpy and PowerBI to perform a Walmart data analysis.

The first step is to import the necessary libraries into your workspace.
To do this, open up your terminal and type: 
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

Next, you need to obtain the necessary Walmart data for your analysis. 
You can download the data from Walmart’s public API or from a third-party website such as Kaggle.

Once your data has been acquired, you can start performing your analysis. 
Using Pandas, you can easily manipulate and clean the data. Using Numpy, you can analyze the data using built-in functions. 
And using PowerBI, you can visualize your findings.

You can create a mini portofolio by taking snapshots of your data analysis. 
This will help you showcase your work and demonstrate your technical abilities to potential employers.
Finally, the results can be visualized using Power BI. This is a powerful dashboard that allows users to create interactive visualizations and dashboard reports. 
This will enable the analysis team to present the results in an effective way and make informed decisions.
